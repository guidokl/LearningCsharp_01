// Polymorphism         = Greek word that means to have "Many Forms".
//                        Treating different objects as their common base type
//                        Objects can be identified by more than one type
//                        Ex. A Dog is also: Canine, Animal, Organism
//                        Allows a List<Animal> to hold Dogs, Cats, and Birds
//                        Code is written for the Parent, but executes Child behavior
