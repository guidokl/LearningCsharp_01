# LearningCsharp_01
C# OOP Learning Playground

Welcome to my C# learning repository! This solution acts as a playground where I experiment with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, test code snippets, and follow along with C# tutorials.

Each project within this solution isolates a specific topic, making it easy to reference syntax and logic patterns later.

## 📂 Project Structure

The solution is organized into separate Console Applications, each focusing on a specific C# fundamental:

| Project | Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L00_Testing** | Sandbox | A scratchpad for quick experiments and testing assumptions. |
| **L01_StaticClasses...** | Static Members | Understanding methods/classes that belong to the type, not the object. |
| **L02_StaticClassAttr...** | Static Fields | Managing shared state across all instances. |
| **L03_GettersAndSetters** | Encapsulation | Controlling access to data using Properties. |
| **L04_Inheritance** | Inheritance | Creating derived classes to reuse parent code (`: base`). |
| **L05_Polymorphism** | Polymorphism | Treating derived objects as their base type. |
| **L06_Poly...BankAccount** | Real-world OOP | A practical example applying polymorphism to business logic. |
| **L07_AbstractOrVirtual** | Overriding | The difference between `abstract` (must override) and `virtual` (can override). |
| **L08_ConstructorChaining** | Constructors | Using `this()` and `base()` to manage object initialization. |
| **L09_MethodOverloading** | Overloading | Creating methods with the same name but different signatures. |
| ** L10_Interfaces** |	Interfaces | Defining contracts to force specific behaviors across different classes. |

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `Learning_01.sln` in **Visual Studio**.
3. Right-click the project you want to run (e.g., `L04_Inheritance`) in the Solution Explorer.
4. Select **"Set as Startup Project"**.
5. Press `F5` or click **Start** to run the code.

## 📚 Sources & Inspiration

The code in this repository is heavily inspired by various C# educational channels on YouTube. It serves as a personal knowledge base and practice ground.

## 📝 Notes

* **Top-Level Statements:** Some projects may use newer C# features like Top-Level Statements.
* **Comments:** I have added "Head Comments" to most files to explain the core concepts (Definitions, Signatures, etc.).
